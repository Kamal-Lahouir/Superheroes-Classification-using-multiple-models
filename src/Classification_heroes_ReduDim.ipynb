The target is balanced between rows.\n","\n","\n","#### Models\n","\n","As a baseline, we use **Logistic Regression** as it is easy to implement, understand, and should provide an already decent predictive power.\n","\n","We will continue with using **SVM**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **XGBoost**. The reason behind using those is because they are known and proven to be the most powerful conventional machine learning algorithms.\n","\n","#### Feature Reduction\n","\n","As our dataset has little amount of examples in comparison with the amount of features, it would be interesting to try to reduce the complexity of the dataset, to see if we predict better or not. One of the main assumptions behind dimensionality reduction is that the high complex datasets capture a lot of unnecessary information which can be reduced into a arbitrable amount of principal components that explain the variance of the underlying data, with the ideal case that the model will be trained with more rellevant information. To get a glampse of whether the dimensionality reduction will work or not, we can use t-SNE algorithm to plot high dimensionality data into two dimensions, colored by the label value (Human / Not-Human) and see if we can already infer a way to discriminate our dataset.\n","\n","For the sake of reducing dimensionality, we will use the classic PCA with different amount of components and study what is the impact that it does to our dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":127,"metadata":{"_uuid":"3a8458dda9204cd7c641e07d8334dd604a798abe","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","\n","X = heroes.drop([\"label\"], axis=1).values\n","y = heroes[\"label\"].values\n","scaler = MinMaxScaler()\n","# transform data\n","X = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n","# X = preprocessing.scale(X)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"d7778ef070c431dc7a86ba32a6b4e90ef0682424"},"source":["### Training classifiers"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":146,"metadata":{"_uuid":"43edf10da64c22b80c533f7094c33a45835b6aee","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold, GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn import svm\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":147,"metadata":{"_uuid":"27811e27b57731e0fea58af9e1a2474a31092f12","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Initialize a stratified split of our dataset for the validation process\n","skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":148,"metadata":{"_uuid":"7ff0a93db2524e7cdb9482b2bdb05bb3a47ae89b","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Training  LogReg\n","LogReg  CV accuracy score: 71.65%\n","Training  SVM\n","SVM  CV accuracy score: 69.58%\n","Training  RF\n","RF  CV accuracy score: 76.28%\n"]}],"source":["models = [\"LogReg\", \"SVM\", \"RF\"]\n","\n","for model in models:\n","    print( \"Training \", model)\n","    if model == \"LogReg\":\n","        clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, solver='liblinear')\n","    elif model == \"SVM\":\n","        clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear',C=1)\n","    elif model == 'RF':\n","        clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=8, random_state=1)\n","    \n","    results = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5).mean()\n","    print( model, \" CV accuracy score: {:.2f}%\".format(results.mean()*100) )\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"dbb4a5076b67a15046f3efd03d60ae304a9054fc"},"source":["### Feature Importance\n","\n","Of the best model seen, which is XGBoost.\n","\n","Code obtained in kernel published by sendohchang https://www.kaggle.com/sendohchang/classify-superhero-is-a-human "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"bdb2249fd8c16475675a2cb458cbd52461388469"},"source":["### Dimensionality Reduction"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":136,"metadata":{"_uuid":"e98b968e478d558984d20830e5fcec38b9b83f7a","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.decomposition import PCA"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":142,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["Index(['Eye color', 'Hair color', 'Height', 'Publisher', 'Weight', 'label',\n","       'Female', 'Male', 'bad', 'good',\n","       ...\n","       'Web Creation', 'Reality Warping', 'Odin Force', 'Symbiote Costume',\n","       'Speed Force', 'Phoenix Force', 'Molecular Dissipation',\n","       'Vision -
